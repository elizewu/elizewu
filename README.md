This is a folder containing scripts and data for data extraction and statistical analysis 
of my dissertation on the topic: investigation of the development of working memory in relation to structural brain development
Within this folder there are scripts in the "Scripts" folder and raw data separated according to measure in the "Data" folder
The analysis involves both behavioural (Corsi tapping task and WASI_II) and brain (structural MRI) data
Follow the steps below to extract relevant data and recreate the analysis, for any questions please email: elizewu2010@gmail.com

Step 1: Extracting relevant data and combine behavioural data as one file
Run the script "Behavioural Data Extraction" to create four combined files of behavioural data with demographic information: two for Corsi Tapping Task (Working Memory measure), 
one for WASI (IQ measure) and one combining both behavioural measures. 
The files created are "age_merged_corsi.csv", "age_merged_corsi_rt.csv", "age_merge_wasi.csv", and "behavioural_data.csv", which are saved in the "Data" file 
These files are used for following analysis 

Step 2:Behavioural Data Analysis
Run the script "Behavioural Data Analysis" for statistical analysis of the behavioural measures, the script included codes for statistics and creating graphs 
The first section of the script focus on analysing the Corsi Tapping Task, comparing performance between age groups, gender and schools
The second section is for WASI-II analysis, comparing scores between age groups, gender and schools
The third section combines Corsi and WASI-II data, to investigate the relationship between the two measures 
Results of statistics and graphs are displayed in the output of the script which were used in the dissertation 

Step 3:Brain Data Extraction and Analysis
Run the script "Brain Data Extraction and Analysis"
The first section is for brain data extraction, extracting cortical thickness measures of hemispheres and ROIs from output of FreeSurfer
The second section includes brain data analysis and analysis of brain and behavioural data together, codes include statistical analysis and creating graphs
Results of analysis are displayed in the output of the script which were used in the dissertation
